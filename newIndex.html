			<p> Levon is amazing. He made this website, and he is also sorta dumb. I think he has dementia. I can't count the number of times that guy just suddenly up and went from doing one thing to another. he is like a jack of all trades, except he never do the trades. he is just jack. Except not really cus his name is Levon. Levon says alot of incriminating things, but I don't know if I can state them all here. For legal reasons. He keeps leaving me to say hes gotta call Saul, but he just comes back with milk and cigarettes instead. Levon doesn't even smoke. Anyways I made this website because we need help. Him and his friend Steve wants to build a minecraft village as big as the moon and make a metalverse of mount Jumanji. a meltaverse is a place where you can eat sleep and wear clothes however you want with no consequences. But please, no dogs allowed. This mentalverse would be the biggest virtual world ever created in the history of militiaverses. If you would like to fund us, please send a check to: 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
